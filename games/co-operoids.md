Co-operoids is a local multiplayer take on the classic arcade game Asteroids. Team up with a friend, or let the AI be your wingman as you pilot ships through an endless asteroid field, blasting space rocks into oblivion.

What's it about?
You and a partner share one screen, dodging and destroying asteroids that split into smaller, faster chunks when hit. Clear each wave to advance to the next stage, where even more asteroids await. Lose all your lives and didn't manage to pickup an extra? Don't worry if your Partner can save the day you can continue, if not.... Game over. But don't worry, you can always try again.

Key Features
2-Player Co-op: Grab a friend and play together on the same screen
AI Partner: Flying solo? An AI buddy has your back...maybe
Classic Gameplay: Screen wrapping, momentum based movement, and satisfying explosions
Stage Progression: Each wave brings more chaos as asteroid counts ramp up
Extra Live pickup if you destroy 80% of the asteroids, goes to the player with the least amount of life. So you can help out your partner if they run out.
Retro Vibes: Clean pixel art with that nostalgic arcade feel
Watch Mode: Let the AI play itself, and see how good/bad they are.
Whether you're competing for the high score or just trying to survive one more wave, Co-operoids delivers simple, addictive fun.
