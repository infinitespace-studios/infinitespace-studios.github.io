<p>I would like to apologise to the MonoGame community as some of the articles were quite useful.</p>

<p>To the Hacker in question. Thanks for pointing out a security hole in software that I didn’t write or maintain. May I suggest that you hack the actual workpress site next time as they are in the position to fix these holes you so expertly used to ruin a free site run by someone in their spare time.</p>

<p>You have not only wasted my time but damaged/hindered many game development projects which used the information on my blog to write their software.</p>

<p>I do not wish you any ill will, however I would like to point out that Karma isn’t so forgiving so the next time you stubb your little toe on the table think of this site and all the people you inconvenienced :)</p>
